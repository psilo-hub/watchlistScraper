## Next Steps:

1. **Create additional scraper services** for TMDb, OMDb, etc., by implementing the `ScraperService` interface
2. **Implement torrent search functionality** - need to decide which torrent site(s) to scrape
3. **Add more robust error handling** and retry mechanisms
4. **Implement rate limiting** to avoid being blocked by websites
5. **Add more logging** for better debugging
6. **Implement unit tests** for the services
